Caroline De Tender finished her PhD in 2017. She studied the microbial communities of plants (rhizosphere) and the marine environment (plastic debris) in function of plant health and biofilm formation. Currently, her focus lays on the study of soil amendment effects on the plant-microbiome system. Caroline combines wetlab research with omics data analysis at the StatOmics group, with a focus on metabarcoding, shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics.
