#### Bio

I did my master thesis in Biomedical Sciences at UGent, where I carried out a combination of both wetlab experiments and computational coding in the field of cell migration. Iâ€™m extending cell migration analysis software with data analysis and mining strategies to understand cell migration plasticity and heterogeneity.
