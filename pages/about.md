#### Bio

Lieven Clement received his master in Bio-Science Engineering in 2000 and obtained a PhD in Environmental Statistics in 2007 from Ghent University. In his postdoc he switched to Statistical Genomics. Between 2008-2012, he did several internships with Prof. Ciprian Crainiceanu and Prof. Rafael Irizarry in Johns Hopkins University (Prof. Irizarry is currently in Harvard University). In 2010 Lieven Clement joined faculty in the Leuven Biostatistics and Statistical Bioinformatics Centre, KU Leuven and he is now Associate Professor of Statistical Genomics at Ghent University, Belgium. He serves as a member of the core team that established a new Master Program in Bioinformatics at Ghent University, as a board member of the Belgian Proteomics Association, as an expert in genomics projects of the Belgian Health Care Knowledge Center (KCE), and as an Associate Editor for the journal Biometrics (2011-2017). Lieven Clement is also a strong advocate of open and reproducible science communication, which he also actively propagates in all his academic courses.

Since 2007, Lieven Clementâ€™s research focussed on Genomics and Statistical Bioinformatics problems. In particular he developed methods for microarrays, digital PCR, next-generation sequencing (genomics and transcriptomics), and mass spectrometry based proteomics (identification and quantification). His research efforts resulted in numerous publications on novel methods and tools for, and applied research in, omics data analysis. His lab is built around three strategic research pillars each connected to an omics domain: (meta)genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. He is also keen on leveraging expertise in experimental design, data analysis and integration for omics studies.
