#### Bio

Lieven Clement received his master in Bio-Science Engineering in 2000 and obtained a PhD in Environmental Statistics in 2007 from Ghent University. In his postdoc he switched to Statistical Genomics. Between 2008-2012, he did several internships with Prof. Ciprian Crainiceanu and Prof. Rafael Irizarry in Johns Hopkins University (Prof. Irizarry is currently based in Harvard University). In 2010 Lieven Clement joined faculty in the Leuven Biostatistics and Statistical Bioinformatics Centre, KU Leuven and he is now Associate Professor of Statistical Genomics at Ghent University, Belgium. He serves as a member of the core team that established a new Master Program in Bioinformatics at Ghent University, as a board member of the Belgian Proteomics Association, as an expert in genomics projects of the Belgian Health Care Knowledge Center (KCE), and as an Associate Editor for the journal Biometrics (2011-2017). He is also a strong advocate of open and reproducible science, which he actively propagates in all his academic courses.

Since 2007, Lieven Clementâ€™s research focusses on Genomics and Statistical Bioinformatics problems. In particular he developed statistical data analysis methods for microarrays, digital PCR, next-generation sequencing, and mass spectrometry based proteomics. His research efforts resulted in numerous publications on novel methods and tools for, and applied research in, omics data analysis. His lab is built around three strategic research pillars each connected to an omics domain: (meta)genomics, (single cell) transcriptomics and proteomics. He also is keen on leveraging his expertise in experimental design, omics data analysis and integration towards researchers in the life science and translational research.
