**Bio** Lieven Clement received his master in Bio-Science Engineering in 2000 and obtained a PhD in Environmental Statistics in 2007, both from [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be). In his postdoc he switched to Statistical Genomics. Between 2008-2012, he did several internships with Rafael Irizarry in Johns Hopkins University (currently based in Harvard University). In 2010 he joined faculty in the Leuven Biostatistics and Statistical Bioinformatics Centre, KU Leuven. He is now Associate Professor of Statistical Genomics at [Ghent University](htpps://www.ugent.be). Since 2007, Lieven Clement's research focussed on Genomics and Statistical Bioinformatics problems. In particular he developed methods for microarrays, next-generation sequencing (genomics and transcriptomics), and mass spectrometry based proteomics. He is also keen to leveraging expertise to experimental design and data analysis for omics studies as well as to translational research. He also serves as a member of the core team that established a new Master of Science in Bioinformatics at Ghent University, as a board member of the Belgian Proteomics Association, as an expert in genomics projects of the Belgian Health Care Knowledge Center (KCE), and as an Associate Editor for the journal Biometrics (2011-2017).
