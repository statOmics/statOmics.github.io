#### Bio

Lieven Clement graduated as Master in Bio-Science Engineering  at Ghent University in 2000 and obtained a PhD in Environmental Statistics in 2007 at the same University. In his postdoc he reoriented his research to Statistical Genomics and he did several internships with Prof. Ciprian Crainiceanu and Prof. Rafael Irizarry in Johns Hopkins University (Prof. Irizarry is currently based in Harvard University). In 2010 Lieven Clement joined faculty in the Leuven Biostatistics and Statistical Bioinformatics Centre, KU Leuven. He is now Associate Professor of Statistical Genomics at Ghent University, Belgium. He serves as a member of the core team that established a new Master Program in Bioinformatics at Ghent University, as a board member of the Belgian Proteomics Association, as an expert in genomics projects of the Belgian Health Care Knowledge Center (KCE), and as an Associate Editor for the journal Biometrics (2011-2017).

Since 2007, Lieven Clementâ€™s research focusses on Genomics and Statistical Bioinformatics problems. In particular he developed statistical data analysis methods for microarrays, digital PCR, next-generation sequencing, and mass spectrometry based proteomics. His research efforts resulted in numerous publications on novel methods and tools for, and applied research in, omics data analysis. His lab is built around three strategic research pillars each connected to an omics domain: (meta)genomics, (single cell) transcriptomics and proteomics. He is a strong advocate of open and reproducible science, which he actively propagates in his research and all his teaching activities. He is also keen on leveraging his expertise in experimental design, omics data analysis and integration to researchers in the life science and translational research.
