#### Bio

Ludger Goeminne received his master in Bio-Science Engineering in 2013 at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be). He is now a PhD student in the Clement group, supervised by prof. dr. Lieven Clement and co-supervised by prof. dr. [Kris Gevaert](http://www.vib.be/en/research/scientists/Pages/kris-gevaert-Lab.aspx) from the [VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology](http://www.vib.be/en/research/departments/Pages/VIB-UGent-Center-for-Medical-Biotechnology.aspx).

In the statOmics group, Ludger focusses on methods to improve quantification in MS-based proteomics. In 2015, he demonstrated that peptide-based models outperform summarization-based approaches. Encouraged by these results, he developed [MSqRob](http://github.com/statOmics/MSqRobHurdlePaper), an R package that combines legitimate statistical modeling for relative protein quantification from peptide-level data with an easy-to-use graphical interface. Additionally, Ludger won the best flash talk presentation award at [Eubic Winter School 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874391917301203) and he was a member of the [vibes 2017 PhD Symposium](https://vibconferences.be/event/vibes-in-biosciences) Organizing Committee.
