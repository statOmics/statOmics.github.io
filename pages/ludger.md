In the statOmics group, Ludger focusses on methods to improve quantification in MS-based proteomics. Therefore, he works on a shared project together with the proteomics lab headed by Prof. Kris Gevaert (VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology). In 2015, he demonstrated that peptide-based models outperform summarization-based approaches. Encouraged by these results, he developed MSqRob, an R package that combines legitimate statistical modeling for relative protein quantification from peptide-level data with an easy-to-use graphical interface (http://github.com/statOmics/MSqRobHurdlePaper). Additionally, Ludger won the best flash talk presentation award at Eubic Winter School 2017 and he was a member of the vibes 2017 PhD Symposium Organizing Committee (https://vibconferences.be/event/vibes-in-biosciences). Ludger can be contacted on ludger.goeminne@vib-ugent.be.
