#### Bio

During my studies of Biology, I discovered the complex but fascinating world of microorganisms. This interest has led me to my PhD, where I am investigating the relation between soil microbiology and soil quality at ILVO (Institute of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food). If I am not working on the field or in the lab, I am developing a new regression framework for high throughput meta-genomics data at StatOmics.
