### StatOmics Group
The Statistical Omics Group, headed by Prof. Dr. [Lieven Clement](pages/about.md), is part of the [Department of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics](https://www.ugent.be/we/twist/) of the [Faculty of Sciences](https://www.ugent.be/we/en) of [Ghent University](htpps://www.ugent.be), Ghent, Belgium.
StatOmics' researchers develop novel statistical methods and tools for the interpretation of omics data.
Our research is structured according to the 'omics domain: Genomics (meta-genomics), Transcriptomics (RNA-seq and single cell RNA-seq) and Proteomics (identification and differential analysis in mass spectrometry based quantitative proteomics). We also leverage expertise in experimental design and data analysis for omics to researchers in the life sciences and have a keen interest in 'omics data integration.
